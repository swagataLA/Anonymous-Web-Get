============================================================================

This package includes the following files:

|-- awget.py [This file contains the functions to execute a call to begin the onion router.]

|-- ss.py [The file that allows awget to jump from peer to peer while relaying and deleting the file.]

|-- README.txt [This file]


HOW TO RUN
=============================================================================

To run awget.py:
	$: python3 awget.py <URL> <chainlist.txt>
		Where URL is the URL you are requesting information from, and the chainlist.txt is optional; however, there has to be a file called chaingang.txt.
		Example URL: http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs457/p2.html
To run ss.py:
	$: python3 ss.py <Port Number>
		Where the Port Number is a valid port number, and is also optional. If you decide not to add it, it defaults to 20,000.


BUGS
=============================================================================

If you send a URL with a forward slash at the end of it, it will not grab the correct file.
